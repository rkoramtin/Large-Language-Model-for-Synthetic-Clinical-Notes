# Large-Language-Model-for-Synthetic-Clinical-Notes


This project utilizes a large language model to generate synthetic clinical notes that closely resemble real clinical documentation. The primary goal is to provide a dataset for research and development purposes while maintaining patient privacy.

## Overview

The framework presented uses advanced NLP techniques to ensure the synthetic notes retain essential medical information and structure, making them valuable for training machine learning models without risking sensitive data exposure.

## Features

- Generation of synthetic clinical notes mimicking real-world clinical documentation.
- Ability to capture crucial medical information such as diagnosis, treatments, and outcomes.
- Structure preservation to maintain the format and readability of clinical notes.
